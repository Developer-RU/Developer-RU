Developer-RU — lead architect and founder of WASH-PRO TECH Global. I turn algorithms into real devices: from C/C++ code for ESP32, STM32, AVR to board design and serial production. 14+ years in embedded development, with devices on the market.

I create not just firmware, but complete products. The value of code lies in its operation on real hardware. Currently opening up my experience through public repositories, sharing my work. Always seeking new challenges and growth opportunities in embedded systems and adjacent technologies.

Focus on fault tolerance, energy efficiency, and hardware-backend integration. Open to expert discussions, consultations, and collaborations.
